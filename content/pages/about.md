I'm a software engineer living in Boulder, Colorado, not far from my hometown of Longmont, Colorado.

My dad sparked my interest in computers early on. At 11 or 12 I found and read an excellent
[introductory Java textbook][1]

<span class="sidenote">At one point, I printed all ~800 pages out. No binding or anything, just a big stack of paper.
Simpler times...</span>. I was immediately hooked, but quickly became interested in developing graphical interfaces for
my programs. Building GUIs in Java proved tiresome, so I started to poke around with web programming... and well, I
haven't stopped since.

In high school, I was deeply involved in the [FIRST Robotics Competition][2] with the incredible [Team 1619 Up-A-Creek
Robotics][3]. The relationships I developed with mentors on the team grew into a sequence of professional
opportunities. First, I interned for Workday on the team from [freshly acquired Gridcraft][4]

<span class="sidenote">Workday's stock price has tripled since this acquisition.</span>, a startup co-founded by
Up-A-Creek mentor Terry Olkin. Two years later, Terry co-founded Left Hand Robotics. I interned for and eventually
worked full-time for Left Hand Robotics from a handful of months after its conception all the way through [its
acquisition by The Toro Company][5].

During this time, I was a student at Northwestern University, studying Computer Science in the Engineering school.
